# Pomodoro Timer

The Pomodoro Timer is a time management tool that follows the Pomodoro technique of dividing work into 25-minute sessions, followed by 5-minute breaks. After four work sessions, a 20-minute break is granted. This timer enables users to manage their time more effectively by tracking completed work sessions and remaining time until the next break.

## How to Use
To use the Pomodoro Timer, follow these steps:

1. Download or clone the repository to your computer.
2. Run `python main.py` to start the timer.
3. Use the start and stop buttons to control the timer. 
4. Note that if you stop the timer, all progress will be reset, and the timer will restart the cycle of work sessions and breaks from the beginning.
5. Once you complete your first work session, checkmarks will appear to show completed work sessions and remaining time until the next break.

If you have any questions or issues, please feel free to reach out to me. I hope you find this tool helpful in managing your time more effectively!
